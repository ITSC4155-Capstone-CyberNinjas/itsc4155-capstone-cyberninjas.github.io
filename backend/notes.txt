A nice introductory guide to FastAPI: https://realpython.com/fastapi-python-web-apis/ 

FastAPI docs: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/ 

Since the map HTML will be rendered per user input. Given multiple users are using
the website, will all the rendering be done locally? 

- Folium + Flask example https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/flask.html 

- Endpoint functions: "You can return a dict, list, singular values as str, int, etc."
	- Also can return PyDantic models

- Can declare path parameters like f-strings in the HTTP method decorator

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id):
    return {"item_id": item_id}

- Automatic data type validation

- Path parameters different from "query" parameters
	- query parameters are the key-value pairs that go after the '?' in URL 

- datetime datatypes supported: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-data-types/ 

Main functionality needed by the back-end is to return data to map generation script based on user input. This needs to be applicable for both WiFi and Transportation pages. 

Endpoints:
	- .../wifi/map
		- 
	- .../transportation/map 

Could pass date as a *query parameter*  
	- no body should be needed for these endpoints

- Need to like actually understand this: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/ - some insight to what the innerworkings of FastAPI is actually doing. 
	- Dependencies are great to use when shared logic and shared conenctions may be used over and over. Both of these are relevant to our app
